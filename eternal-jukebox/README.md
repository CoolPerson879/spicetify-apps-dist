A rewrite of the [Infinite / Eternal Jukebox](https://eternalbox.dev/jukebox_index.html) for Spicetify.  
It finds pathways through similar segments of the song and plays a never-ending and ever changing version of the song.

## Usage

A new "infinity" button allows you to enable and disable the jukebox. As long as the jukebox is enabled, the current song will play endlessly.

Changing the current song will automatically play it through the jukebox.

The custom app allows you to see a visualization of the jukebox's progress through the song.

Holding the `SHIFT` key allows you to keep repeating a part of the song by "jumping" through edges linking the same beats.
